        <h2>Synopsis</h2>

        <img class="haru-monster" src="haru-monster.jpg" alt="Monster Haru">

        <p>The story starts off with the two once best friends riding in separate trains. There is a monologue about their current life and events that have occurred. They start to reminisce about the past and think about the one fateful winter night where the two of them slowly drifted apart. Suddenly, we see the two boys in their childhood days playing Pakèmon. Dialogue is exchanged and they subtly state their problems at home. They then bring up the mayor statue a top the mountain and the green boy decides he wants to blow it up. Following the green boys idea, the blue boy wants to run away after blowing it up far away from where they live. The two agree to the conditions and make plans to do it the next day.</p>

        <div class="spoiler-content" id="spoiler">
          <p>As they explore through the forest going up the mountain, they come across a dead deer. The two inspect it and walk away from it. Suddenly, they start to feel sick and pass out near the carcass. A monster comes up to the boys, as if inspecting them, and turns away. Upon waking up, the two starts to see different realities...</p>

          <p>They encounter different characters (Spouses, a hunter, a dog, and Haru) as they traverse through the forest and we learn more about the boys’ personalities and their viewpoints...</p>

          <p>They wake up and notice the boy Haru is gone. They keep traversing the mountain trying to find Haru and to reach the top of the mountain...</p>

          <p>...they see the world as normal. The blue kid changed his mind on running away from home and the green boy just followed him to keep him safe. A scream is heard nearby so the boys go and inspect it...</p>

            <p>BOKURA is described as a two-player co-op puzzle platformer. The players go through puzzles as children and then transition into different realities: one sees animals, the other sees machines.</p>
            <p>Players must communicate effectively as they traverse through the forest/mountain, each being able to interact with different objects. Big time decisions must be made which influence later events along the game.</p>
            <p>What I love about the game is the different soundtracks to each kid. The green side has vibrant colors, so there is a more upbeat soundtrack for what he sees. The blue side has a more lax soundtrack with calming and robust visuals.</p>
            <p>The story is beautifully made and simplistic. We learn more about each kid's personality and traits as we progress. There are certain moments where players see different dialogue and must converse on which decision is best.</p>
            <p>What I barely found out is it can be played three times for three different endings to be seen. The puzzles stay the same, but the endings change — a neat detail that encourages replaying.</p>

        <p><strong>Blue Kid (Age 10):</strong> Lives with his mother, who often goes to the bar with her boyfriend. His father is not present in the picture and does not have much money.</p>
        <p><strong>Green Kid (Age 10):</strong> Comes from a wealthy family, but is ignored by both parents. He feels invisible and says they argue frequently.</p>

        <p>Through their journey, we see how each child processes family and emotional struggles. Their interactions with other characters reveal deeper layers of their personalities, such as the campfire dialogue with Haru and the parents searching for their son.</p>
