        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>I find the game interesting because of the gameplay aspects and the narrative. I am always a sucker for soundtracks so I found it fascinating that each perspective has its own soundtrack and sound effects. It may not have 2d smooth visuals, but the eight-bit style gives the game some life as well. Some puzzles were easier than others and I liked how the two players have their own things to interact with. It made me feel like both players were equal.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the narrative, I like how different but alike the two boys are. We know no background on the boys when we first begin. As we progress the story and encounter other characters, we learn more about the boys. Their interactions with the other characters reveal deeper layers of their personalities, such as the campfire dialogue with Haru and with the Father and Mother searching for their kid. Upon inspecting the picture above, we see the way the two kids see their worlds. One Steam user notes the way the kids see their different reality is how the kids feel on the inside and their experiences in the real world.</p>

        <h2>Connection to Readings</h2>

        <h3>Lacan and the Mirror</h3>
        <p>We learned about Lacan's mirror stage and then had to reflect it to the game of LIMBO. The professor states, "Our selves are not isolated, uniform static beings; they are in a constant dialectic exchange with our own reflections in the mirror." I relate this reading to the game because there is some kind of attachment we feel for the characters we play as. Both characters have their own personalities and problems at home. We can relate this to ourselves by our experiences — or another way to put it — looking into a mirror. With this in mind, I connect Silverman's idea of the suture to the game as well.</p>

        <h3>Silverman and the Suture</h3>
        <p>Suture was described as "something quite vivid and specific that connects you to the game." There are a few specifics in the game that make one feel connected to the game. The two boys mention "Pakemon" on the train and we travel back in time when the two boys were kids playing the game. I would say many grew up playing or knowing the famous game "Pokemon," so this connects the players and reminds them of their childhood days with that specific friend. For instance, I had a childhood best friend who I would always play Pokemon with. As we grew up, we kind of separated and do not speak to each other often. Then the other part of the game is the blue kid wanting to run away and the green kid wanting to cause mischief by blowing up the statue. The way the two characters are and their family history is, players can feel connected to the two young kids.</p>
